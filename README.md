![Suspicious Susie saying Like, uh, hey, maybe things took a recreated in Bevy right now...](./assets/susie_dialogue.png)

## Tentative roadmap

- [ ] Get the sprites in the window
- [ ] Get the sprites in the right place
- [ ] Get the basic functionality working in some order
- [ ] Add animations

## Animations to replicate

- [ ] Each party member GUI slides up and down
- [ ] Lines in each party member GUI coming in from both sides and fading
- [ ] In the item view when there are too many to show, the arrow pointing down oscillates vertically
- [ ] Soul tweaks out and leaves Kris into the battle box as it expands outward Soul tweaks out and leaves Kris into the battle box as it expands outward. The opposite happens on end of battle box sequence.
- [ ] Fight mode bar has a trail that it leaves behind, and when you enter fight mode Kris readies their sword
- [ ] When you attack, the rectangle attack area flashes white, Kris swings their sword, then a slash appears over the knight (along with the damage)
- [ ] In general there's animations for all the different modes, like defending causes Kris's sword to become a shield
- [ ] Rude buster
